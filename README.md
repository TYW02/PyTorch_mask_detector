# Automated Machine Learning
This project will take in user's dataset and perform Exploratory Data Analysis as well as return the best fit model by comparing performance metrics across multiple different models.

## What is Automated Machine Learning ? 
- AutoML is the way toward automating the start to finish the cycle of applying AI to certifiable issues.
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is tied in with producing Machine Learning solutions for the data scientist without doing unlimited inquiries on data preparation, model selection, model hyperparameters, and model compression parameters.

## Limitations of AutoML
- AutoML can not supplant the data scientist's expertise and undertaking definition however encourages him to maintain a strategic distance from the technical work-related to the model development.
- AutoML is there to quicken their work, permit them to rapidly attempt things, and help them to improve results.



## Input dataset
To input your desired dataset.

1. Select your file extension. Only 3 types of file extensions are currently available (Excel, CSV, Parquet)
2. Click on the "Browse file"
3. You will see a view of your dataset once it has loaded in. (This might take awhile depending on the size of your dataset)
